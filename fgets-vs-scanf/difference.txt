The main difference between scanf() and fgets() is that scanf() saves input as a sequence terminated by a space, whereas fgets() saves input as a sequence terminated by, i dont know newline or zero byte?

This is important especially with c, where scanf() can take the first name of someone, like John...
while fgets() can take the first and last name of someone, like John Kremer.
