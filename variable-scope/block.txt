In C, the other variable scope appart for global is the block scope.

We utilize the block scope when we declare a variable inside a function.

What is a block? A block is everything in between 2 { } brackets.
"between" should be read here litteraly here.

For example: a function that is declared outside
another function(because you cant declare functions in functions) 
will be deemed outside the block.

What does that mean? If in a function we use another function,
that function will not have access to variables specifed in the block
of the outer function, unless they are "force fed" into the function via
parameters.


int main() {
	int integer = 69;
	printInteger();     <--- does not see the 'integer' variable
	return 0;
}

printInteger() {            <--- declared outside the main() function
	...
}
