One of the variable scopes is the global scope.

The global scope is utilized when we declare a 
variable outside the main() function, in other words
it is everything that is declared with no identation.

Globaly declared variables are able to be invoked in every
block in the program.

int variable = 52

int main() {             <--- main() sees the 'variable'
	...
}

It is also good to acknowledge, that functions themselves
are variables. That is why we can invoke something like
"printHello" in the main function, because "printHello"
was declared in the global scope!

int main() {             <--- sees the 'printHello()' function
	printHello();
	return 0;
}

void printHello() {      <--- declared in the global scope
	printf("Hello!")
}
